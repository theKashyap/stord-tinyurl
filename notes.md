* Kindly refer to README.md for instructions on how to setup, run and test the application.
* Couple of notes from my exchange with David Hardwick:
>Kashyap>> David, you mentioned "what other way can I suggest, to evaluate my coding skills". One possibility is to see code/advice I provide in [my answers on stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/496289/kashyap) (or questions I posted). I usually pick topics I'm trying to learn and answer as many questions as possible, to aid with my own learning. I would of course complete the tiny-url exercise.

>David>> this is cool! you should add that to your notes.txt file, I think the reviewer might dig seeing that!

* Other note for the evaluator:
>David>> As we discussed, you can do this in any language, it doesn't have to be Elixir or React, and we'll focus more on the backend, testing, and devops during the evaluation.
